# Overview

This notebook provides a structured introduction to **Functions in Python**, covering both the basics and advanced concepts.  
It is designed for learners who want to understand function creation, argument types, and higher-order functions with practical examples.

## Topics Covered

1. **Function in Python** – Introduction and importance of functions.

2. **Creating a Function** – Syntax and examples of function definitions.

3. **Types of Arguments**  

   - Default Arguments  
   - Positional Arguments  
   - Keyword Arguments  
   
4. **`*args` and `**kwargs`** – Passing variable-length arguments.  

5. **Nested Functions** – Defining functions inside other functions.  

6. **Functions as First-Class Citizens** – Assigning functions to variables, passing them as arguments, and returning them.  

7. **Returning a Function** – Functions that generate and return other functions.  

8. **Function as Argument** – Passing functions into other functions.  

9. **Lambda Functions** – Creating anonymous, single-expression functions.  

10. **Higher-Order Functions**  

    - `map()` – Apply a function to all items in an iterable.  
    
    - `filter()` – Select items from an iterable based on a condition.  
    
    - `reduce()` – Perform cumulative operations on an iterable.
